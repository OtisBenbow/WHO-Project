# Predictive Modelling - WHO Project
### Using continuous models in python to predict a country's life expectancy.
In this project, as a team we were asked to use data from the World Health Organisation (WHO) to predict the life expectancies of countries across the globe. One of the main focuses of the project was to consider data integrity. <br>
Several countries have expressed concerns over sharing data that may bring about unwanted financial implications when correlated with their quality of life measurements. So, the main task of the project was to produce a function capable of predicting life expectancy using either:
- An elaborate model, using all the useful data that helps to accurately predict life expectancy.
- Or an ethical model, able to predict life expectancy using the least information necessary to make an accurate prediction.

The function will start by prompting the user to indicate whether they consent to the use of their advanced population data. Their response will determine which model is used.
There were 5 deliverables all in the form of python notebooks each representing a different section for the creation of the model:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Modelling
- Testing
- The Final Function
